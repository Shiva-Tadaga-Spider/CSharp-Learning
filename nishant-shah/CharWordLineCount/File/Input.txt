This has happened to me several times, but I'm not sure how to report it.
So I repeated the lesson immediately to practice the other words, and the same thing happened again! I get that heureux has an odd declension pattern, but I feel that the other words barely got any practice.
For instance, today I did lesson one of Adjectives 4 in French, and I got about 10 sentences in a row with "heureux".
